Welcome to the project site of PHP Charts for MediaWiki.

**What is pChart4mw?**<br>
PHP chart for MediaWiki (pchart4mw) is a MediaWiki extension for visualizing data in different types of charts. Using pchart4mw's simple syntax you can create professional charts like bar, pie, line, radar, scatter and bubble charts, all within a MediaWiki server environment. pChart4mw uses the 'pChart Library', this is a free PHP Chart library able to create different types of charts. The pchart4mw extension serves as an <a href='Introduction.md'>interface</a> between MediaWiki and the 'pChart Library'.<br>
<br>
It can produce professional charts like these ones for example:<br>

<b>Where do I find more information?</b><br>
See our <a href='Introduction.md'>wiki</a> to learn about installing and using pChart4mw.<br>

We hope you'll enjoy working with this extension.<br>
